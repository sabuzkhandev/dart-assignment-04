Define an abstract class Account with the following properties:
● accountNumber (integer)
● balance (double)
It should also have the following methods:
● deposit(double amount): Adds the specified amount to the account balance.
● withdraw(double amount): Abstract method that deducts the specified amount from
the account balance.
Define a class SavingsAccount that extends the Account class. It should have an additional
property called interestRate (double).
Implement the withdraw() method in the SavingsAccount class as follows:
● Subtract the specified amount from the account balance.
● Apply the interest rate to the remaining balance.
Define a class CurrentAccount that extends the Account class. It should have an
additional property called overdraftLimit (double).
Implement the withdraw() method in the CurrentAccount class as follows:
● Allow withdrawals up to the overdraft limit.
● If the withdrawal amount exceeds the overdraft limit, print a message indicating
insufficient funds.


In main()
● Create an instance of the SavingsAccount class by providing values for the account
number, initial balance, and interest rate.
● Use the instance to perform operations like depositing and withdrawing money.
● Create an instance of the CurrentAccount class by providing values for the account
number, initial balance, and overdraft limit.
● Use the instance to perform operations like depositing and withdrawing.
